## Treasury style on accounting

When a "treasury style" for clearing and reporting is selected, FX trades are decomposed in their respective single currency components. We report the currencies positions that result from your trades.

If treasury style accounting method is chosen, marking to market is operated by calculating the USD conversion value of each of your Currency Positions.

On a "treasury style" enabled account, margin is calculated at currency level, where total-risk shows the current used margin on each currency:

## Example

If you bought 100K of EUR/CHF @ 1.5700, we will report a long position of 100K in EUR (a positive position) and a short position of 157K in CHF (a negative position).
