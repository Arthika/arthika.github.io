## Trading Interface (TI)

A trading interface is the communication channel between Arthika's trading platform and a [venue](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Venue).

Each communication channel allow receiving prices from the market and sending [orders](https://github.com/Arthika/REST-API/wiki/Trade) to such market.

All trading interfaces can be easily configured at Arthika's trading platform's GUI:

Each TI has different parameters:

* **TI Name** : Name of the Trading Interface. This name is shown on many Arthika's trading platform objects, and it's heavily used with prices, [orders](https://github.com/Arthika/REST-API/wiki/Trade) and [trades](https://github.com/Arthika/REST-API/wiki/Trade).    
* **Commissions mode** : Each time a [trade](https://github.com/Arthika/REST-API/wiki/Trade) is executed a commission will be charged. This field defines how commission is settled: Using system's denomination currency, in the base/term [asset](https://github.com/Arthika/REST-API/wiki/Asset) of the traded [security](https://github.com/Arthika/REST-API/wiki/Security) or in a specific asset (usually USD).    
* **Venue** : Exchange market access provider (known as '[venue](https://github.com/Arthika/REST-API/wiki/Venue)'). Underlying FIX protocol depends on this selection. TI has different parameters to hold different venue contact information.
* **FIX parameters** : All protocol information required to establish both FIX connections (streaming and trading sessions) : Host, port, account, username, password, senderCompId, targetCompId, SenderSubID, ...
* **[Securities](https://github.com/Arthika/REST-API/wiki/Security)** that should be subscribed in order to receive prices from.
