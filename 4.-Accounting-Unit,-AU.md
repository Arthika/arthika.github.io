## Accounting Units (AU) and Equity Pools (EP)

Arthika's trading platform holds all its accounting information into small units called 'accounting units' (AUs).
An 'equity pool' (EP) is defined as a group of accounting units.
Any accounting unit must be assigned to one equity pool.
The 'key concept' is that all accounting units in the same equity pool shares their equity (this will be explained later).

An equity pool is typically formed by the following accounting units:

* One **Wallet AU** : This accounting unit holds all the manual cash transfers executed from the backoffice. When a trader begins to trade, the starting cash will be present in this AU (which would be transferred from his bank account). This AU can not be used to open positions ([cash positions](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/Spot) when account is configured to operate in [spot markets](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/Spot) or [security positions](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/Single-Swap) when account is configured to operate in [swap markets](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/Single-Swap)).

* One **Manual Trading AU** : This accounting unit will be used by the platform when the trader executes trades from the Manual Trading screen at platform's GUI. Any position manually opened from GUI will be stored in this AU.

* One or more **strategy AUs** : At Arthika's trading platform, any trader can operate with different strategies simultaneously. Each trading strategy will be assigned to one 'strategy AU'. The accounting associated to a trading strategy will be stored in the corresponding AU (any opened position).

Arthika's trading platform shows all the accounting information associated to each AU of the same EP different GUI screens:

### Accounting information

Each accounting unit will held the following information per each [prime broker account](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/PB-Account) defined in the platform:

* **Opened security/swap positions** : When [PB account](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/PB-Account) is configured to operate in [swap markets](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/Single-Swap).

* **Opened asset/cash positions** : When [PB account](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/PB-Account) is configured to operate in [spot markets](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/Spot).

* **Total risk** : Combining all opened positions, Arthika's trading platform calculates the [total-risk](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/Total-Risk) generated on each [asset](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/Asset).

* **Marked to market** (or M2M) : Once positions are opened (manually by the trader or programatically by a trading strategy), each opened position will have a value in the system's denomination currency according to market rates on each instant. Arthika's trading platform will calculate M2M of each accounting data in the AU.

#### Programming

Arthika's trading platform API offers several [JSON services](https://github.com/Arthika/User-Manual/wiki/Position-and-Accounting) that can be used to retrieve all accounting information from AUs.
