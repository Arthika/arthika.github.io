## Spot

A spot contract, spot transaction, or simply 'spot', is a contract of buying or selling a commodity, [security](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Security) or currency for settlement (payment and delivery) on the spot date. 
In the spot market, or cash market financial, instruments or commodities are traded for immediate delivery.

The settlement price (or rate) is called spot price (or spot rate). A spot contract is in contrast with a forward contract or futures contract where contract terms are agreed now but delivery and payment will occur at a future date.

Spot positions (also called 'cash positions' or 'asset positions') can be easily cheked at Arthika's Trading platform GUI:
