## 1. Prime Broker Account (PB Account)

Account provided by a licensed brokerage where the trader deposits his funds (used for trading).
PB Accounts are tipically defined by the backoffice administrator through a backoffice GUI:

Each PB account is defined by some special parameters:

* **Account Name** : Name used for defining the account (tipically used on REST API calls)
* **Prime Broker** : List of available licensed brokerages supported by the platform.
* **Max. leverage** : Agreed maximum [leverage](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Leverage) between the trader and the prime broker. This leverage allow a trader to open positions with a higher [total-risk](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Total-Risk) than the equity deposited in the account.
* **Instruments** : When platform executes an order (sent by a trading strategy), the resulting [trade](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Trade) is settled depending on the instrument used by the market. Currently supported instruments are: [SPOT](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Spot) and [SINGLE-SWAP](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Single-Swap).
* **Margin Calculation** : When platform executes an order (sent by a trading strategy), a new position is opened or closed, changing the [available margin](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Leverage) (available equity) that the trader can use in future orders. This [available margin](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Leverage) can be calculated in two different ways: [TREASURY style](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Treasury-Style) and [MARGIN-STYLE](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Margin-Style)
* **Rollover** : When the market uses a [SINGLE-SWAP](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Single-Swap) to calculate the settlement of a [trade](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Trade), a SWAP position is opened. If the SWAP position remains opened, after a defined time period a [swap rollover](https://github.com/Arthika/API-REST/wiki/Swap-Rollover) will occur. This parameter defines the time period between rollovers: DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY or UNDEFINED (no rollover is applied).
* **Backoffice information** : These parameters help a backoffice administrator to keep contact information of the prime broker's backoffice.
