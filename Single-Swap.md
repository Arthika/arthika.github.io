## Swap

A foreign exchange swap, forex swap, or FX swap, is a simultaneous purchase and sale of identical amounts of one currency for another with two different value dates (normally spot to forward)

The simplest swap structure is to exchange only the principal (base asset) with the counterparty at a specified point in the future at a rate agreed now. Such an agreement performs a function equivalent to a forward or futures contract.

A foreign exchange swap has two legs—a spot transaction and a forward transaction—that are executed simultaneously for the same quantity, and therefore offset each other.

In Arthika's trading platform a 'single swap' conforms a unique foreign exchange swap, linked to a specific security, which is recalculated when a new swap is opened at the same security.    

Opened single-swaps can be easily checked at Arthka's Trading Platform GUI:
